# Omega Flowey in Minecraft - Remastered

Back in early 2016 I released `Omega Flowey in Minecraft`.

- [original thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/Undertale/comments/4a9jht/spoilers_omega_flowey_boss_fight_in_minecraft/)

Since then I've gained a lot of skills both in Minecraft map development and in programming generally. This repo will store any and everything relating to development of a remaster of the original map for modern Minecraft version(s) with better gameplay, performance, and visuals.

### Setup

#### Workspace

<!-- TODO upgrade to yarn 4? -->

1. Install [`Node.js >= 16.10`](https://nodejs.org/en/download)
1. Install [`Yarn 3.6.3`](https://v3.yarnpkg.com/getting-started/install) by running `corepack enable`
1. Initialize the repo by running `yarn`
1. Enable Yarn's Plug'n'Play with VSCode by running `yarn dlx @yarnpkg/sdks vscode`

#### Testing

1. Download the [Fabric mod loader](https://fabricmc.net/) and install a new profile to your Minecraft launcher
2. Download the [Fabric API](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/fabric-api/files) jar
3. Download the latest release jar of [`packtest`](https://github.com/misode/packtest/releases)
   1. You should probably download the same version that we're currently specifying in `./.github/workflows/validate.yml`
4. Move the `Fabric API` and `packtest` jars into your `mods` folder in the Minecraft directory (typically `%appdata%/.minecraft/mods`)
5. Run the new profile in your Minecraft launcher to launch a (lightly) modded instance that's able to run `packtest`'s new commands designed for testing
   1. Try: `test runall`
   2. See `packtest`'s [README](https://github.com/misode/packtest) for full command documentation
